15)log1p(x):

18)deg(x):
➢ Any real number by default is considered a radian measure. Deg(x)
converts any radian measure into degree measure using the formula:
DEGREE/180⁰ = RADIAN/π

​19)gamma(x):
➢ It is a function used in calculus and complex number theory
predominantly, hence is most precisely defined in the Argand plane in
polar coordinate system. It is defined for all complex numbers except
non-positive integers.
➢ It is mathematically defined as:
Which is basically the definite integral of non-negative complex numbers in
the interval [0,∞) over the Argand plane.

20) beta(x):​
=>Beta function is also a definite integral of input variable (say x) just like 
gamma function, except that it follows the empirical relation:​

=>B(x,y)= (Γ(x).Γ(y))/Γ(x+y) = B(y,x) for all x>0,y>0
